## Google Search Grounding

The podcast agent now supports Google Search grounding, which allows Gemini to access real-time web information for more accurate and up-to-date content. When enabled:

- **Real-time Information**: Get current facts and data about your topic

This is particularly useful for topics involving:

- Current events and news
- Recent technological developments

- Latest trends and developments

## Script Structure

Each podcast episode is generated as 3 complete segments:

1. **Part 1 (Introduction)**: Welcome message, topic introduction, and what listeners will learn
2. **Part 2 (Main Content)**: Key insights, facts, and detailed discussion with host interactions
3. **Part 3 (Conclusion)**: Key takeaways, wrap-up, and call-to-action

Each part is designed to feel like a complete segment of a real podcast episode with natural host conversations and smooth transitions.
